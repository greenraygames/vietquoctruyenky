# Viet Quoc Truyen Ky Project

This repository is dedicated to the development of the **Viet Quoc Truyen Ky**.

All files here are part of the **frontend** for both the official **Viet Quoc Truyen Ky** website and the web-based game. The frontend is designed to provide an engaging user experience for players, with responsive design, interactive elements, and smooth gameplay integration.

The game code (not here) isn't open source, but you can view it freely by reversing the executable file (we didn't obfuscate it).

This project is developed and maintained by **Green Ray Games** - an indie game development team.
